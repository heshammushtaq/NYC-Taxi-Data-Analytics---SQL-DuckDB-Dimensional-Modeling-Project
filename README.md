### NYC Taxi Data Analytics — SQL, DuckDB & Dimensional Modeling Project
 Overview

This project builds a full end-to-end data analytics pipeline using the NYC Yellow Taxi dataset.
It replicates the type of workflow used in real data engineering & BI environments:

Acquire large transactional data

Clean and wrangle millions of records

Design a star-schema dimensional model

Load data into fact/dimension tables

Use SQL to answer business questions

Visualize findings and explain insights

The project simulates real-world analytics — not just queries, but modeling, validation, and interpretation.
